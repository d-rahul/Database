Create an instance of the AppSQLite class and do the changes as per requirement with the table 
here I have done for the one table you can do as many with tables.
    
    AppSQLite appSQLite = new AppSQLite(/*SQLiteDatabase reference*/, "User"/*Your table name in which you want to upgrade changes*/);
    appSQLite.addColumn("firstname", "INTEGER");....
    appSQLite.renameColumn("firstname", "name");....
    appSQLite.removeColumns("name");....
    appSQLite.renameTableName("Employee");//User ==> Employee
    appSQLite.execute();//This is necessary for every table changes execution

    ArrayList<ColumnInfo> allColumns = appSQLite.getAllColumns("Employee");
    
    AppSQLite appSQLite1 = new AppSQLite(/*SQLiteDatabase reference*/, "Friends"/*Your table name in which you want to upgrade changes*/);
    ......
